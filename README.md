# Solving the Eight Puzzle with different Search Algorithms

In this project we attempt to solve the 8 puzzle using Uniform Cost Search, A* Misplaced Tile heuiristic and A* Manhattan Distance heuristic.
We get a solution trace of the path taken by each method to reach the goal state of the 8 puzzle. The number of nodes expanded and the the maximum size of the queue is
also displayed for each search method which makes for a good comparison. There are different sample initial states from which the search algorithm attempts to reach the goal state. One can input a custom initial state as well.
Upon running the solver with different search methods on different samples, one will notice that the A* algorithms perform better than the Uniform Cost Search.
The Manhattan Distance heuristic performs the best as the complexity of the puzzle increases.
